// FIXME: Casting a pointers to size_t is inherently
// nonportable. For example, systems exist where pointers are 64 bits
// and size_t is 32. One idea would be to use a different type
// for refs such as uintptr_t, the problem with this one is that
// while it is described by the C++11 standard it is not required to
// be present. C++03 does not even mention it. A real working solution
// will be to introduce a new name for the type of refs. The typedef
// can then be made as complex as required to pick out an appropriate
// type on any supported platform.
//
// A better solution may be to use an instance of SlabAlloc. The main
// problem is that SlabAlloc is not thread-safe. Another problem is
// that its free-list management is currently exceedingly slow do to
// linear searches. Another problem is that it is prone to general
// memory corruption due to lack of exception safety when upding
// free-lists. But these problems must be fixed anyway.
