Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables - check out [realm.io](https://realm.io). 

This repository holds the source code for the core database component used by all the Realm Mobile Database products:
[realm-java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java), [realm-cocoa](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa), [realm-js](https://github.com/realm/realm-js) and [realm-dotnet](https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet). Realm Core is not in itself an "end-user" product with a publicly stable and supported API. It is the intention to build a publicly supported C++ API (see [this issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-core/issues/1954)), but that will be a separate product and likely build on top of [realm-object-store](https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store).
